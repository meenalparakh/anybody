# *Any*Body: A Benchmark Suite for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation

This repository contains code for the [AnyBody benchmark suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14986). It includes a configurable robot set, standardized benchmark scenarios, and training pipelines for RL algorithms. The benchmark is based on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim). 

This repository includes:

* [**Installation**](docs/installation.md)
* [**Benchmark**](docs/benchmark.md)
* [**RL training**](docs/train.md)
* [**Cluster Guide**](docs/cluster.md)

We thank the authors of these repositories, which have been instrumental in building this benchmark suite.

## Ongoing Development
This project is under active development. Specifically:
- The training and evaluation configs (and commands) in this repo are provided as examples for running policies. The exact hyperparameters used in the paperâ€™s experiments will be released soon.
